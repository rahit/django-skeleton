# this is a very simple script that tests the docker configuration
# it is meant to be run from the root directory of the repository, eg:
# sh tests/test_docker.sh
set -ex

# run the model service's tests
docker-compose -f local.yml run prediction pytest

# run the project's tests
docker-compose -f local.yml run interface python manage.py test

# return non-zero status code if there are migrations that have not been created
docker-compose -f local.yml run interface python manage.py makemigrations --dry-run --check || { echo "ERROR: there were changes in the models, but migration listed above have not been created and are not saved in version control"; exit 1; }
